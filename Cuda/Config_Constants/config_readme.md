# General Info

<h2>File and variable format for config file</h2>  

- The config file allows empty rows and comments ("//" at start of comment line) for formatting the presentation of the contents, also allows in-line comments with only requirement being a space from the value assignment
- The parsing process currently does not attempt any verification of assigning values to variables (lack of assignment nor duplications).  When reading values, it takes the assignment and uses the standard string to int/double for appriopriate variable types and does not currently handle arithmetic
- When reading the file, the assumption is made that the config file contains valid simple values for all variables.  Also that there are no spaces until after the variable value assignment

<h2>Config file structure</h2>  

- Whenever the code runs, three config files are used to gather info 
- First, genetic.config is read. This file holds info on the details of how the genetic algorithim should run, such as how strong mutations are. 
- Second, mission.config is considered. It holds the goals (minimize relative speed) and retraints (triptime min/max) of the genetic algorithim. It also hold the file address for the target body.
- Finally, the file containing info on the target body for the run. The information should include final position and velocities for the origin, target, and any graviational assist body. It should also include info on the setup of the spacecraft for the mission.

<h2>The cudaConstants struct</h2>

- In the code, the structure that uses the config file is called <b>cudaConstants</b> and is only accessed when being constructed (therefore changing the config file during a run would have no impact).
- An overloaded << operator for cudaConstants that outputs the object's contents with labelling/formatting for better readibility to output onto terminal screen in the main function.
- For changing what config file is used, the file address can be changed where cudaConstants is declared within the main function in optimization.cu. Requires re-compiling the code.
- Default address is "genetic.config" in same folder as the .exe file, optimization.cu has address set as "../Config_Constants/genetic.config".
- If config file address is invalid, will output to terminal that is the case.

# Recommended Config Values
A table to elaborate on why some variables are assigned certain values

| Variable Name              	| Recommended Value  	| Reasoning 	|   |
|-----------------------------	|-------	| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---    |
| [base bennu.config](\Base_Target_Configs\base_bennu.config)    | N/A   | The base config file used for missions where bennu is the target  |   |
| [base didymos.config](\Base_Target_Configs\base_didymos.config)    | N/A   | The base config file used for missions where didymos is the target  |   |
| [base marsOdyssey.config](\Base_Target_Configs\base_marsOdyssey.config)    | N/A   | The base config file used for missions where mars (oddesy mission) is the target  |   |
| [base marsOrbit.config](\Base_Target_Configs\base_marsOrbit.config)    | N/A   | The base config file used for missions where mars (orbital mission) is the target  |   |
| [base psyche.config](\Base_Target_Configs\base_psyche.config)    | N/A   | The base config file used for missions where psyche is the target  |   |
| mutation_rate                 | 0.5-0.75       | From test runs involving different mutation rates for the impact mission, 0.5 showed to be most effective at converging on a solution.  This was for singlue mutations, while mutation rates for more genes occurring after only showing no serious change. Rendezvous missions seem to need more mutations, so current rate 0.75.                         |       |
| triptime_min                  | 0.0-3.5         | These values are going to be mission dependent. For example, the bennu mission is best done as a redezvous mission with a triptime_min of 1.0. The didymos mission is similar. The psyche mission should have a min of 3.5, and the mars orbital should start at 0.5.   |       |
| triptime_max                  | 1.5-6.0       | As stated for the min, the max is also mission dependent. The bennu mission should end at 2.0. The didymos should end at 1.5. Psyche is a bit different as some of their missions plan to take 6 years while some end at 5 years. The mars orbital should be 1.5.  |       |
| timeRes                       | 3600      | Equivalent to 1 hour, this resolution for deriving earth location elements to store is considered sufficient.  For triptimes that fall between two indexes, the position/velocity is interpolated by a weighted average. This may need to be lower for mission that actaully use Mars' gravity as it is a very precise calculation.   |       |
| max_generations               | 5001-10001     | With current status of convergence rates for the algorithm in finding a valid solution being in the low thousands range, 10001 generations is considered plenty of time for the algorithm to find a solution and if it does reach this point then it won't find a solution as the annealing would become too small to lead to notable change that leads to a solution. Most missions should converge within 5000 generations. |       |
| num_individuals               | 2880      | Population size is based on the number of available threads in the Tesla GPU, optimizing the rate a pool can be calculated.   |       |
| survivor_count                | 720       | The genetic algorithim is able to dynamically create children as needed. However, through testing we have found 720 individuals to be a goood middle-ground value.    |       |
| thread_block_size             | 32        | Based on the Tesla GPU.   |       |
| best_count                    | 1         | It was found that in a given run, the best individuals when convergence occurs are very similar to each other, so setting more than 1 does not lead to more different solutions in a single run.  |       |
| doublePrecThresh              | 1e-12     | The double data type experiences loss in precision for differences in two elements within runge-kutta that as a result could lead to differences between the CPU and GPU computations of runge-kutta.  This value is a starting point in finding the smallest threshold for that difference. |     |
